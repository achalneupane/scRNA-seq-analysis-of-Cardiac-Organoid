# scRNA-seq Analysis of Cardiac Organoid

## Project Description

This project involves single-cell RNA-seq analysis of cardiac organoids generated by combining 15% endocardial cells with 85% cardiomyocytes. The organoids were treated with factors to induce trabeculation. Our preliminary results show that all groups except for **LVNC** respond to this stimulation.

We aim to:

1. Identify transcriptomic differences between **control** and **cardiomyopathy** groups.
2. Investigate the unique features of **LVNC** by comparing it to other cardiomyopathies (DCM and HCM), with a focus on trabecular/compaction processes.

## Sample Grouping

- **Control**: `S19-3`, `S25-3`, `S26-3`  
- **Cardiomyopathy (DCM)**: `GW10`, `GW53`, `GW168`  
- **Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: `GW129`, `GW167`, `GW169`  
- **Cardiomyopathy (LVNC)**: `GW30`, `GW64`, `GW159`

## Data Processing

Raw reads from two sub-libraries were processed using the Parse Biosciences `split-pipe v1.0.6p` pipeline with the **GRCh38** reference genome and default parameters.

## Code Notes

All code used in this project should use **relative paths** or placeholders (e.g., `<DATA_PATH>`, `./results/`) to ensure reproducibility and compatibility across systems. Absolute file paths have been removed for security and portability.
